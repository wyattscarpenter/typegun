Run a bunch of python typecheckers on a project, to see if there are any problems. This grew out of a script I would cart around, which I decided to make a reusable package.

This only includes typecheckers that have a reasonable shot at typing near-current-version python projects mostly-correctly, in my (non-scientific) opinion, a list which may vary over time. The versions of these typecheckers are completely unpinned, all the better to get the most recent versions of them probably. It also includes [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), which is not a typechecker, but is very useful for code quality nonetheless.
